# FinalProject_Template

This repository contains templates for CSCI 1430 project deliverables of many kinds: proposals, progress checks, project reports, presentations, posters, etc.
Each template may not be required for your final project, e.g., some semesters we might not perform presentations. We simply collect them all here for ease.

At the beginnning of the project, you will submit a project proposal detailing the methods and data you plan on using in your final project.

A progress report will be due sometime in between the proposal and submission of the final project. This report will consist of accounts of work done by each individual team member so far on the project.

Finally, at the end of the project, you will submit a full project report. You will also complete an accompanying poster or presentation detailing your project, depending on the year. 

Feel free to look at individual files in this repository for more information. Good luck!
