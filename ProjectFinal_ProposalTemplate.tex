  \item -----
  \item What are the skills of the team members? Conduct a skill assessment!
  \item What data will you use?
  \item What software/hardware will you use?
  \item Who will do what? [For anonymity, please use `'`Team member 1 will...'' or, alternatively, take on daring pseudonames.]

\section*{After Proposal Submission}

\subsection*{TA Assignment}

After handing in your project proposal, your team will be assigned a TA to assist you.
You should aim to meet with your TA once a week; this replaces TA office hours.

If you haven't heard from your TA a few days after the project proposal handin, please make a private Ed post and let us know which team you're on.

In your first meeting with your TA, your goal is to have your idea sanity-checked:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Do you actually have the data?
  \item Do you actually have the compute?
  \item Is there code you need but don't have access to?
  \item Is there an area where you need help?
\end{itemize}

Some of these things will be outlined in your proposals, but talking through it with your TA as soon as possible will help you find potential road blocks and get the ball rolling.
